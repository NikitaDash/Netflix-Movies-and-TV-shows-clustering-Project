# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-shows-clustering-Project

## Project Summary:

Netflix, a renowned streaming service, has revolutionized the way we consume entertainment. Launched in 1997 as a DVD rental service, it boldly transitioned to an online streaming model in 2007. Today, it stands as a global entertainment giant, boasting over 200 million subscribers across 190 countries by 2021.

The secret to Netflix's unparalleled success lies in its innovative business approach and its commitment to original content. The company makes substantial investments in creating its own movies and TV shows, which have garnered accolades and drawn top-tier talent. Furthermore, Netflix employs sophisticated algorithms to curate personalized content recommendations for users, leveraging their viewing history and preferences.

The core objective of this project was to uncover underlying patterns in Netflix's extensive content library and categorize it into distinct clusters based on commonalities such as genres, sub-genres, release years, and other features. The project harnessed the power of machine learning algorithms, specifically K-means clustering and Hierarchical Clustering, to classify and group this wealth of data. Through this endeavor, we sought to enhance the content discovery experience for Netflix users and gain insights into the evolving landscape of entertainment.

## Project Description:
This project constituted a comprehensive endeavor focused on analyzing Netflix's vast content repository through the lens of advanced machine learning techniques, specifically deploying K-means clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. The core objective was to uncover latent patterns and similarities residing within the extensive collection of movies and TV shows, shedding light on various attributes such as genres, sub-genres, release years, and viewer ratings. The resulting clusters not only streamlined and organized the content for improved user experience but also served as valuable inputs for fine-tuning Netflix's recommendation system, thereby paving the way for more personalized content suggestions tailored to individual preferences.

At the heart of this project was a profound commitment to prioritize the end-user experience. Our primary goal was to adeptly categorize the shows available on the Netflix platform into distinct groups or clusters. This endeavor was grounded in the idea of elevating content discoverability. By classifying shows in a manner that ensured those within a cluster shared pronounced similarities while standing out from shows in other clusters, our aspiration was to simplify the process for users to discover shows that resonated with their unique tastes and interests.

In a broader context, this project seamlessly aligns with Netflix's pioneering approach to content delivery and its enduring success in the dynamic streaming service industry. By optimizing content discoverability and enhancing personalization, it not only enriches the user experience but also plays an instrumental role in solidifying Netflix's position as an industry leader, catering to the ever-evolving demands and expectations of its global audience.



## Problem statement:
* Netflix is the world's largest online streaming service provider, with over 220 million subscribers as of 2022-Q2. It is crucial that they effectively cluster the shows that are hosted on their platform in order to enhance the user experience, thereby preventing subscriber churn.

* We will be able to understand the shows that are similar to and different from one another by creating clusters, which may be leveraged to offer the consumers personalized show suggestions depending on their preferences.

* The goal of this project is to classify/group the Netflix shows into certain clusters such that the shows within a cluster are similar to each other and the shows in different clusters are dissimilar to each other.
